<p>Remember how when we were kids, we’d always create a fuss to have our way?
Mom’s chocolate cookies had to have the chocolate sprinkles, the jacket you’re
getting must be the one you want, no matter what the fashion nazis said, and
Sundays always meant it’s time to visit your cousin. <br /><br />
Proprietary software is
like the the chocolate you buy at a store, which comes wrapped up, and all you
can do is taste it and then, recommend it to your friends or distribute it to
your class on your birthday if you like it. Under far-fetched situations, you
may try to reverse-engineer it. <br /><br />Open Source Software, in contrast, is like the
scrumptious chocolate batter you come up with when your friends are home and
you decide to make something awesome! When Mom isn’t around, you enter the
kitchen, look around at everything there, pick out the best looking
ingredients, mix them in a bowl, take a deep breath and give it a taste. Yuck!
Tastes awful doesn’t it? What do you do? You call your friends to help! But
Mom can’t have mess in the kitchen, so you’ve got to have some order right? So
you distribute the batter among your friends and let each one experiment and
taste what they have. You can always merge the best ones and have the most
delicious batter right? Could you have ever made this batter alone?

In all its glory, the Open Source Community is a huge family that is based on
the purest human intention of helping others, contributing to society and in
general trying to make the world a better place (or the best chocolate batter!
). <br />With Open Source software, you have the freedom to run it, study how it
works and adapt it to suit your own personal needs. <br /><br />In this world, the contact
you’d make with your friends would be over an `IRC` ( Internet Relay Chat )
where they’d ask you what you’re doing and how to get started on it, and you’d
redirect them to a `Repository` having whatever you’ve done so far and give
them advice on how to continue from there. <br /><br />Once they’ve made changes on their
branch, they would send you a `pull request` which you could then `merge` into
your `Repo` if you feel you like it. Before you know it, you have the best
collaborative effort!

OpenVPN, Mozilla, Xchat, OpenStack, Tor are just a few of the thousands of
orgs that have gone the Open Source way :) We hope to find you on the IRC’s
soon!
